# City Inhabitant Nomenclature Predictor

Often cities have specific terms used to describe their inhabitants. For instance:

- **London** --> *Londoner*
- **Paris** --> *Parisian*
- **Delhi** --> *Delhitie*
- **Mumbai** --> *Mumbaikar*
- **Kolkata** --> *Kolkatan*
- **Berlin** --> *Berliner*


## Goal:

Develop a predictor which, given the name of a city, will provide the likely term for its inhabitants.

## Requirements:

1. Accept the city name as input.
2. Provide the term for its inhabitants as output, or indicate if the term is unknown.
